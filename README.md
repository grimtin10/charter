# Charter

Charter is a general data visualisation web app, usable through an API. You give it the numbers, it gives you the pretty lines!

Charter was created out of the need to visualise data taken from other APIs, in situations where limitations from the programming language being used, project structure, or some other issue, caused graphical interfaces to be needlessly difficult to be created.

Charter is built on the thought of "data in, colors out". Charter makes it very simple, you just feed it the data!
